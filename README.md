### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Philippe Llerena, Fortiche's CTO. I'm working in VFX and Animation industry since 2005ish. I have a female jackhuahua named [Fury](https://www.instagram.com/furythedestroyer) because, she is furious.

## Languages

I'm fluent in English, French, python. I know a little bit of Japanase and EspaÃ±ol. I started developpement in basic with my dad's casio and latter my T.I 89. I learn java at college but i forgot everything. During covid i started Rust because of a joke with Paul Parneix and hit the [GIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock). I'm now learning Rust and i'm very happy with it. Here some of my rust project: [quiet-stroll](https://github.com/forticheprod/quiet-stroll), [fls](https://github.com/forticheprod/fls), [salon prob](https://github.com/doubleailes/salon_prob)

## Projects

### framels
[fls](https://github.com/forticheprod/fls) project is intent to deliver a ls command inspired by bls from Buf Compagnie or more recently rvls from RV.

Here is an exemple of the usage of my fls library:

```bash
cargo add framels
```

In your main.rs

```rust
use framels::{
    basic_listing, parse_dir,
    paths::{Paths, PathsPacked},
};
let source = "./samples/big".to_string();
let paths: Paths = parse_dir(&source);
let results: PathsPacked = basic_listing(paths);
println!(results);
```

### python template cookiecutter

Since i learn to use cookiecutter at Superprod, thanks to Jordie Bastide and Marc Dubrois. I can't stop using it. I wrote a couple of ones for **python 3** at Fortiche.

My latest one is [rusty-cookie](https://github.com/doubleailes/cookiecutter-rust) which a offer a strong base to create a rust package with a wonderful documentation based on [zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and [adidoks](https://github.com/aaranxu/adidoks).

### Moana Island

In 2018, with the help of Tcherno, Vincent Debellis, Djl and Benjamin Legros. I was the first one to re-assembly the Moana Island scene from Disney as far as i know.

## Work

I start as a compositing artist in London, a little bit of mattepainting, then i switch to pipeline TD. I worked at [Mercenaries Engenering](https://github.com/MercenariesEngineering) with [Benjamin Legros](https://github.com/BenMercenaries) and [Cyril Corvazier](https://github.com/hulud75). I had the chance to work on wonderfull project like [Nomand Land](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9770150/). I'm now CTO at Fortiche Prod. I met a lot of peple in this industry and i'm very happy to work with them.

## Hobbies

I'm a big fan of [central texas style BBQ](https://www.instagram.com/fireandfurybbq/), spirits, [Urbex](https://www.360cities.net/profile/doubleailes). I used to was into [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/doubleailes/) but i don't have time anymore.

### Central texas style BBQ

I was always interested in smoky flavor. I smoke cigars but not so much and peated whisky. In 2014 in Paris opned the first texan bbq joint. This place was the only reconize texan bbq outside of texas, **The Beast**. [Crazy stories about this restaurant](https://www.texasmonthly.com/bbq/the-beast/), [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/08/23/travel/paris-restaurants-barbecue.html), [Whasinghton Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/move-over-foie-gras-the-latest-rage-in-paris-is--classic-american-barbecue/2016/01/15/1b3ff700-ba52-11e5-829c-26ffb874a18d_story.html) I started to be friend with the [owner, Thomas](https://www.texasmonthly.com/bbq/interview-thomas-abramowicz-of-the-beast/). But sadly **The Beast** closed during COVID and i was part of his friends who helped him to remove the last furniture.
So in 2020 my girlfriend offer me a big green egg to start bbq by myself. After a couple of years i bought in 2023 my first offset smoker from Texas, a mill scale 94 Gallon built in Lockhart, TX.

Central texas style is defined by 3 things:
- Salt and pepper rub
- Post oak wood
- Low and slow

There is no post oak in France so use [ashwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraxinus) from my family wood and so start to plant my own trees.

I read a lots of book about it. The major one is: Aaron Franklin, smoke.

I'm now cooking for friends and family and i'm very happy to share my passion with them.

Anytime i'm traveling, i try to visit bbq joint. I visited:
- [Hometown BBQ](https://www.hometownbbq.com/) in Brooklyn, NY
- [Moo's Craft BBQ](https://www.mooscraftbarbecue.com/) in Los Angeles, CA
- [Horse Thief BBQ](https://www.horsethiefbbq.com/) in Los Angeles, CA
- [Smokestack](https://www.smokestak.co.uk/) in London, UK
